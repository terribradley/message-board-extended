# Message-board
This app uses Ember to create a question and answer message board. Users can submit, update and delete questions while other users are able to click that question on the homepage and add an answer. They can also save questions for later if they want to come back to answer.  The app highlights popular questions and lists answers in order by the number of times they've been voted for.
